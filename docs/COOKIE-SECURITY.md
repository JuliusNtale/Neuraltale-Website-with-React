# 🔒 NEURALTALE Cookie Security Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the advanced security measures implemented in NEURALTALE's cookie system to protect user data and ensure legal compliance.

## 🛡️ Security Flags Implementation

### 1. **Secure Flag** ✅
```typescript
secure: window.location.protocol === 'https:'
```
**What it does:** Ensures cookies are only sent over HTTPS connections
**Business Impact:** Protects customer data from interception
**NEURALTALE Benefit:** Professional security standards build client trust

### 2. **SameSite Attribute** ✅
```typescript
sameSite: 'lax' // Default setting
```
**Options Explained:**
- **Strict**: Maximum security, may break some functionality
- **Lax**: ✅ **NEURALTALE Choice** - Good balance of security and usability
- **None**: Least secure, requires HTTPS

**Why Lax is Perfect for NEURALTALE:**
- Allows normal navigation (customers clicking from Google/emails)
- Prevents CSRF attacks
- Maintains functionality for business inquiries

### 3. **HttpOnly Protection** 🔒
```typescript
// Note: Can only be set server-side
// Client-side cookies are inherently accessible via JS
```
**What it does:** Prevents JavaScript access to cookies
**Important:** Cannot be set via client-side JavaScript
**Server Implementation Needed:** For authentication cookies

  'allow_google_signals': false,          // Disable cross-device tracking
  'allow_ad_personalization_signals': false, // No ad targeting
})
```
