# EmailJS Configuration Template
# Copy this file to .env.local and fill in your actual values
# .env.local is ignored by Git and won't be committed to your repository

# Your EmailJS Public Key (get from EmailJS dashboard)
NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY=your_public_key_here

# Your EmailJS Template ID (get from EmailJS dashboard after creating template)
NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID=your_template_id_here

# Instructions:
# 1. Copy this file to .env.local
# 2. Replace the placeholder values with your actual EmailJS credentials
# 3. Never commit .env.local to Git (it's already in .gitignore)
# 4. Your private key stays in EmailJS dashboard only - never put it in frontend code
